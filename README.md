This is for utilities to prevent neckbearding

Since bikeshedding and neckbearding are counterproductive, I think these tools would be useful.

Since apparently the standard unix passwordfile is hard, I wrote a converter to JSON!
Even novice web developers understand json, so this should be really handy.
I plan to add more utilities to expose standard system stuff to people with little to no experience to help adoption of best practices.
